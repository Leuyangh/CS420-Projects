Leu-yang Huang Assignment 1 CS420 README
Scale and Translate implemented with glScalef and glTranslatef
Rotation implemented by altering camera position in gluLookAt. Felt more intuitive this way
Control scheme for mouse kept as per the starter code
Scheme to change render type changed to right-click menu instead of keyboard keys
Also implemented: Change gradient color between red, blue, purplish, and green
Included in zip should be the animation, as a .avi recorded by FRAPS
SaveScreenshot was not working for me, and I saw on piazza someone said use FRAPS instead, therefore the Do_Idle 
remains empty.
Program was made in Visual Studio 2017 version, and runs from opening assign1.vcxproj and running the debugger. Or assign1.sln.




























========================================================================
    CONSOLE APPLICATION : assign1 Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this assign1 application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your assign1 application.


assign1.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

assign1.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

assign1.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named assign1.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
