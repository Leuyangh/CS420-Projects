# CS420-Projects
Projects done for CSCI-420 Computer Graphics at USC. Fall 2018

All projects are done through OpenGL on Visual Studio 2017.

Assignment 1 is a heightmap program that takes in black and white JPG images and converts them to a rendered heightmap where
pixel darkness corresponds to a height value. Target image is given in commmand line arguments. Rendered image can be manipulated
with mouse drags combined with shift or control keys.

Assignment 2 renders a roller coaster that moves along the tracks given in "tracks.txt" which holds the .sp files of the track.
Coaster splines are Catmull-rom splines.

Assignment 3 raytraces an image given to it in a .txt file containing data on spheres, triangles, and lights present in the scene.
